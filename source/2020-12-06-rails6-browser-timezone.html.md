Times & Dates in timezone of the user's web browser with Rails 6
================================================================

I like to have times and datest presented inthe user's timezone.

Basecamp's `local_time`
-----------------------

Tried `local_time` and I liked it. But I am missing the knowledge to apply I18n to it.

Custom
------

I droped `local_time` und did something custom.
